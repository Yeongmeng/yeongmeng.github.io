    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">
    <p>Hello! I’m Yeongmeng Li, currently studying Vision Science and Clinical Optometry at the University of New South Wales. I’ve always been fascinated by the sciences and how they intersect with helping people, which is why I was drawn to optometry. My goal is to improve lives by ensuring people see the world clearly, both literally and figuratively.</p>
    <p>Growing up in Sydney, I attended Sydney Boys High School, where I developed a love for learning across diverse fields, from academics to sports and music. Balancing my studies with being part of the school orchestra and excelling in sports taught me the value of dedication, teamwork, and resilience. I was honored to graduate with a strong academic record and multiple recognitions, including the Scholar Sportsman Prize and an Encore Nomination in Music. These experiences shaped my work ethic and my belief in lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>In university, I became deeply involved in various student societies and leadership roles, such as directing educational programs within the Accounting Society. These roles allowed me to not only deepen my academic understanding but also develop skills in organization, mentorship, and IT. I’m especially passionate about creating supportive learning environments, which is why I work as a tutor in my spare time. Guiding students and helping them grow in confidence has been incredibly rewarding.</p>
    <p>Outside academics, I cherish my role as the Director of the Sydney Musicool Orchestra, a group I helped expand over the years to over 100 members across three countries. Music has been a constant in my life, and leading this group has allowed me to combine my love for music with my commitment to community. One of our proudest moments was raising over $15,000 for the Australian Bushfires relief efforts in 2020.</p>
    <p>When I’m not studying or working, you’ll likely find me exploring new restaurants, staying active with football and cricket, or volunteering in community projects. I’m fluent in English and Cantonese, and I’m working on improving my Mandarin. These hobbies and interests keep me grounded and remind me to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.</p>
